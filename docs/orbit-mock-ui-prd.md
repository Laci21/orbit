The Orbit

🧠 TL;DR
The Orbit is an AI-powered command center for handling PR crises. It simulates a live scenario using AGNTCY’s multi-agent system (MAS) to demonstrate how AI agents collaborate to monitor, analyze, and respond to a communications crisis in real-time — all from a single dynamic dashboard.

🧭 User Experience
Core Flow: “From Crisis Detected to Statement Published”
All of this plays out on a single dashboard that updates in real-time with agent-generated outputs. The user doesn’t switch views — the narrative unfolds around them.

Crisis Detection

"Ear to the Ground" Agent flags a viral tweet accusing the company of misconduct.

A red alert appears on the dashboard; click to expand the post thread.

Sentiment Spike

Sentiment Analysis Agent shows a surge in anger and fear.

Word cloud reveals trending terms like “boycott” and “corruption.”

Auto-Agent Coordination

"Ear to the Ground" queries the Agent Directory → discovers Sentiment & Fact-Checker agents.

Agent identities are verified through OASF before collaboration.

Contextual Fact Retrieval

Fact-Checker Agent pulls company’s official crisis response playbook (mock knowledge base).

A policy snippet appears in a side panel.

Drafting the Response

"Press Secretary" Agent synthesizes everything: viral post, sentiment data, internal policy.

Suggests a neutral, empathetic holding statement.

Approval & Publish

User reviews and hits “Approve.”

Dashboard marks the status as “Published.” Other panels fade back to monitoring mode.

🔥 Narrative (The Demo Story)
Imagine it’s 7:38 AM on a Tuesday. Your CEO wakes you up: “We’re trending for the wrong reasons.”

You log into The Orbit — it’s already lit up with a red alert.

A viral tweet accuses your company of corruption. The AI agents are already on it:

One is analyzing public sentiment (spoiler: it's not good).

Another is fact-checking the claim against your company’s crisis playbook.

A third is drafting a preliminary statement, pre-populated with compliant language.

Within 90 seconds, you’ve assessed the situation, understood the vibe, fact-checked the claim, and approved a perfectly toned public statement.

This is what AI-native comms looks like.
